# Microbit_MaqueenPlus_WifiModule
In this project, you will use a micro
connected to a Maqueen Plus robot and an ESP8266 WiFi module. The micro
will control the robot's movements and send sensor data (like temperature or distance) to a remote server. Additionally, commands can be sent to the robot from a web interface or another remote source.

# Components required 

- 1.Micro: The main microcontroller board. <br
- 2.Maqueen Plus Robot: An educational robot that can be controlled via a micro.
- 3.ESP8266 WiFi Module: To enable WiFi connectivity for sending and receiving data.
- 4.Jumper Wires: For connecting the ESP8266 to the micro.
- 5.Power Supply: Batteries for the Maqueen Plus robot and the micro
